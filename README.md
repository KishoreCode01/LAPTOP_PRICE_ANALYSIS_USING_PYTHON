# LAPTOP_PRICE_ANALYSIS_USING_PYTHON
 Analyze factors influencing laptop pricing using a real-world dataset with specifications such as brand, screen size, RAM, GPU, processor, and price.

# 📁 Project Files
* Reinforcement_test.ipynb — Jupyter notebook with full code

* REINFORCEMENT TEST - LAPTOP DATASET DOCUMENTATION.docx — Detailed documentation

* REINFORCEMENT TEST - LAPTOP DATASET PPT.pptx — Project presentation

# 🎯 Objective
  To explore and identify key features that affect laptop pricing using data cleaning, transformation, statistical analysis, and visualization in Python.

# 🧰 Tools & Techniques
* Language: Python

* Libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy.stats

* Techniques: Data cleaning, univariate/bivariate/multivariate analysis, T-Test, ANOVA

# 🧹 Data Preparation Highlights
* Removed duplicates and null rows

* Standardized categories (e.g., Netbook → Notebook)

* Converted and cleaned Inches and Weight columns

* Treated outliers using logical thresholds and mean imputation

* Removed invalid symbols and fixed datatypes

# 🔍 Key Insights
* 💰 Most laptops priced around ₹52,000; price is positively skewed

* 💾 8GB RAM most common; price increases with RAM and dedicated GPU

* ⚙️ Intel dominates with 95% CPU market share

* 🧮 Price is strongly correlated with RAM, moderately with Weight

* 🧪 T-Test: Dedicated GPUs significantly increase price

* 📊 ANOVA: RAM, GPU type, and weight category significantly influence price

* 🏷️ Lenovo leads in entry-level segment and notebooks

# 🧪 Statistical Tests
* T-Test: GPU Type vs Price → Significant difference

* Two-Way ANOVA: RAM, GPU Type, Weight → Significant impact on price

* No significant interaction between company, OS, and processor types

# 📌 Conclusion
  Laptop pricing is primarily influenced by RAM, GPU type, and performance-related specs, not by brand or screen size. Users prefer moderately priced, well-performing laptops, with Lenovo and Dell dominating market share.
